# Project Vitruvius
> [Marcus Vitruvius Pollio](https://www.ancient.eu/Vitruvius/) (c. 90 - c. 20 BCE), better known simply as Vitruvius, was a Roman military engineer and architect who wrote _De Architectura_ (On Architecture], a treatise which combines the history of ancient architecture and engineering with the author’s personal experience and advice on the subject. As no similar work has survived complete from antiquity, the book has become an invaluable source, not only on  [Greek](https://www.ancient.eu/greek/)  and  [Roman architecture](https://www.ancient.eu/Roman_Architecture/) , but also on a wide range of other topics such as  [philosophy](https://www.ancient.eu/philosophy/) , mathematics, and  [medicine](https://www.ancient.eu/medicine/).

## Purpose of this initiative
Collective experience is an invaluable albeit highly perishable resource, and tribal knowledge is hard to come by relying on a number of sociological factors. The idea behind this initiative is to catalog experience-based knowledge into a digestible compendium for all team members. More importantly this idea can exist only in the safe space of collaboration, so the participation and thoughtful conflict that arises from discussing such controversial items is tantamount to its success. If you’re reading this, you’re invited to participate in honing the individual pieces of this document for the rest of the team; just be prepared to [constructively] defend your contributions, as well as participate in sanity checking others!

> *FOR VITRUVIUS, BUILDINGS SHOULD ALWAYS BE THREE THINGS: BEAUTIFUL, STABLE, AND USEFUL.*

This seems like a reasonable source of inspiration for the tenets of this document.

### Document Audience
This document is intended for [**Back of House (BOH)**](./glossary#boh) Engineering team members. This includes DVC software engineers, testers, UX designers, or anyone who has a technical contribution to add to projects. The concepts in this document do not cover, nor intend to cover, [**Front of House** (FOH)](./glossary#foh) concerns. The concepts herein are discussed entirely outside the context of specific client needs.

### Organization
Inspired by _De Architecture_, this document is broken into Books that encompass silo’d engineering concerns. Each book contains many volumes, and may reference others. These are in no particular order, and referenced by book "id" only here in this readme, as each book is intended as a stand alone resource to the given topic.

> NOTE: This compendium should contain no more than 10 books so as to prevent high level topic sprawl.

### The Pirates Code (working title)

  <p>
    Be on the lookout for this marker throughout the books in this compendium. This indicates a time where a certain degree of adherence may either be required or otherwise unnecessary.
  </p>
  <h4>How does it work?</h4>
  <p>
    Based on a <strong>scale of 1-10</strong>, where a 10 indicates the <em><strong>highest possible level of required adherence</strong></em>. Conversely, a 1 indicates that should the need arise the rules therein can be bent or broken as needed to be agile.
